The goal of this project is to make a web application that makes it easier to navigate the collection of a user's timeline on twitter.

We will be making a scheduled job to sync all pushlished tweets from a twitter user timeline to our own database and display the tweets on our UI.


Also we will be integrating a search feature to allow user's search for keywords in all the tweets available

And lastly we will be adding a functionality to allow authenticated user's through the help of twitter social auth to retweet tweets the find interesting.
